# Lap Counter

This is a react native app that I built for my kids school.  

## The problem

My kids school was doing a walk-a-thon fund raiser.  Participants obtained pledges and donations on a per lap basis.  (e.g. Person A pleges to donate $1 to the school for each lap I complete, and person B pleges to give $2).  

They needed a way to keep track of how many laps each participant completed in realtime with a centralized DB, so that multiple trackers could be counting at the same time.

## The solution

A Tracker app built in react native using firebase as a serverless backend and db.
